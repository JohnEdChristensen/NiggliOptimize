create a list of all possible point groups or a given basis

compare this list to a list of another basis to see if they have any point groups in common

possibly automate for every niggli basis 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a list of objects for every basis that includes:
the index for the detOf1 Transform
The transformed basis matrix as a numpy matrix
The number of point group generators
The point group generators
A function that takes in pg generators and returns a one if it is identical to its own
a string that denotes the niggle basis and lattice type
